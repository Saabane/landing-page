# landing-page

This my landing page project from The Odin Project

This page is meant to be submitted as an assignment solution 
for the first flexbox project .

I used almost everything i learned from the course except for some flex-shrink - flex-grow & flex-basis because i didn't see where to use them exactly.

The biggest help was the devtool in chrome which was a game changer.

Note: i'm note really sure what we should put in README.md 
i just typed what i really wanted to remember from this project.
